# Financial Models Project
Welcome to my Financial Models repository!😊 As a passionate high school student deeply interested in finance and quantitative analysis, I've developed this collection of financial models to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation. This toolkit represents my journey in mastering financial modeling through code.
## The Main Motivation
To combine quantitative finance with programming, deepening personal insight into this subjict, I create the repository as a platform for self-learning. The models may be imperfect with some errors, if so, please feel free to point it out. I believe one day I will become one of the best bankers.😎
## Before Running The Code
Every code is equipped with a README, please read it carefully to make out the main feature and aim of the code.The potential running result is also displayed in the file.  Make sure you have already downloaded essential resource.👽
